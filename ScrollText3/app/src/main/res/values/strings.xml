    <string name="article_text">“Some see things as they are, and ask why. I dream of things that never were, and ask why not.” — Robert F. Kennedy\n

A <b>fantasy album</b> is an <i>album</i> of <u>music</u> that never was, but perhaps could have been, if the artists had been inclined to (or legally able to) produce and release it.\n
\n
A fantasy album is plausible as a concept — a collective effort of different artists to put forward a theme, or an alternative that could coexist with an artist’s real works. It is more than a set of playlists with liner notes. Careful attention is paid to the starting and ending song of each album “side” and the song sequence throughout, in order to re-create the album experience of that time and to put forth a concept.\n
\n
The Beatles fantasy <i>“Red Album”</i> is an example. It addresses the idea of what the Beatles might have released if they hadn’t broken up — based on their solo releases.\n
